# Response to Bluemenstock - Don't Forget About Humans in Data for Development

What are some of the promises, pitfalls, and ways forward associated with data science and human development?

###### Promises

Around five years ago, researchers have discovered that people who make more international calls or have more Facebook friends are more likely to repay their debts. The type of alogorithm that can detect these patterns are "machine-learning" algorithms. Other studies use cell phone data and imagery from satellites. For example, in Africa, the wealthy tend to make more international calls while the poorer are more likely to live in thatched roofs according to satellites images. Theoretically, machine learning can help governments and others to distribute aid in a more efficient manner. In adition, it can improve public health during an epidemic or assist nations during emergencies. 

###### Pitfalls

The solutions given by these tools often give more to the rich than to the poor. And in China, people are restricted from riding trains, planes, and subways because of their low "social credit scores", including false reports. These count as unanticipated effects of which the people that introduced the program didn't except the public to act in this way. Lack of validation: the algorithms that detect patterns have only been tested in a handufl of countries and can't be applied everywhere. Also, there is no evidence that the data now will be the same in a few years time. Many factors can change the patterns over time; just because there is a pattern right now does not mean the pattern will stay for long. Biased algorithms: some algorithms don't represent the total population when they run their data. Even with cell phone data, not 100% of the world owns a cell phone, so the algorithm can't account for everyone. Finally, there is a lack of regulation. The data that runs the algorithms are usually owned by private companies, who don't care for much but profit. So, "issues of data privacy, algorithmic transparancy, fairness and accountability are off the radar of most companies in developing countries" (Blumenstock).

###### Ways Forward

Validate. "New sources of data should complement, not replace, old ones" (Blumenstock). New tools should compare with existing tools, or rather benchmarked, to see which is more effecitive. Customize. The technology used is mostly for first-world purpose; searching something on Google and onl relevant searches in your area show up. But what if that algorithm can also do something for non first-world countries? Deepen collaboration. The future solutions should not be left in the hands of those who just know the algorithms, but the ones who understand the problems and context. One example is Datakind, a global network that tries to connect data scientists to "social-change" organizations, which focuses on issues in emerging economies.
