### Problem Statement

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poverty has been an ongoing issue in the world since many millennia ago. As the world and countries develop, the poverty line is driven down; however, the poverty rate can never be driven down to zero percent. And, poverty is especially prevalent in Ethiopia with numbers around 70 to 80 percent of the population living in some type of poverty. As the citizens continue living in poverty, many issues arise, such as: inadequate access to health care, tight living spaces, unclean household areas, food security, susceptibility to disease, and below average household incomes. The inherency of poverty can come from a plethora of factors, but some of the ones discussed seem to focus on agriculture. Most studies conclude that if agricultural methods were improved such that food shortages can be cut; the poverty rate could be driven down.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout recent years, GIS (Geographic Information System) has been more prevalent in the works in mapping countries over the world. This research, however, was dedicated to mapping poverty in the Oromia Regional State in Ethiopia. The general objective of the research is focusing on using GIS and other statistical tools to analyze poverty distribution and linking a relationship between poverty and “different geospatial data”. The technique used for collecting data is a recently developed small-area estimation technique called Small Area Estimation. The main focus of the article is about the spatial representation of poverty. It would help improve public expenditures by mapping the exact location of where the poorest populations live. The author states that by “integrating spatial measures” with data, access to services, water, transportation routes, etc., we could lead ourselves to a more complete understanding of the human development process in Ethiopia. This article also reveals the transparency of the process, and the results are also compared to other geo-spatial databases. Observing other databases, the “general poor worenda” usually steer toward having limited access to road networks, and because of that, access to water is also relatively low in poor areas with a dense population. So, creating a “poverty map” is greatly beneficial for designing, planning, or monitoring poverty aid strategies. But what is poverty? As mentioned in the research introduction, “there is no agreed international definition of poverty”. The author states that poverty can take on many forms that one might not even realize, such as: hunger, lack of shelter, being sick and not having access to  doctor, no access to school, illiteracy, not having a job, fear of what’s to come in the future, living each day as a struggle. Poverty is powerlessness, a lack of representation and freedom. By the definition of government, poverty is whether one’s consumption or income level falls below the minimum level necessary to meet basic needs, called the “poverty line”. Each country, however, has different basic needs and different minimum income levels, so these poverty lines vary in time and place. In general, poverty mapping information is a “means to any persuasive framework”. The research seeks the enhancement of the current understanding of the geographic distribution of poverty and condition where they live. Since this research focuses on the poverty assessment of Oromia, I think this article will help with my general topic of the poverty assessment in Ethiopia.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ethiopia is one of the Sub-Saharan African countries still suffering from widespread severe poverty. Even though the official poverty headcount ratio is 26.9% in 2011, more than 80% of the 86 million people live in rural areas and in severe poverty. Based on the concept of marginality developed by Gatzweiler, Baumuller, Ladenburger, and von Braun, the research focuses on identifying and locating the marginalized poor. In other words, the people who haven’t received the benefits from the economic progress of Ethiopia yet. For data collection, a marginality map of the country was developed using GIS software to overlay different layers that “proxy the seven spheres of life”. The marginality map locates where people are marginalized and in how many “spheres”. The hotspots are defined as areas where marginalized people are in the six or seven dimensions. The method used to identify these hotspots consists of an overlay of the different spheres of life using GIS software. To showcase all the spheres of life while keeping the number of variables as low as possible, only one indicator is chosen for each sphere of life. The article states, “if necessary, the data were geo-referenced using ArcGIS.” All of the datasets were transformed into raster layers with 10-km grids sizes. Then, each of the raster layers are reclassified into dichotomous values so that it’s possible to separate the values, interpreting one set as doing better or worse than the other. The layers are then overlaid, resulting in the marginality map, showing exactly where people are marginalized and in how many dimensions. This paper covered the concept of marginality as a way to address poverty. The concept is then applied to help develop a marginality hotspot map. Generally, the population from urban areas are not affected by marginality as those from rural areas. Overall, overlaying the hotspot map with population maps revealed in more than six million people being marginalized in six or seven dimensions and twenty-three million are marginalized in five or more dimensions. Further, it seems that marginality hotspots seem to be correlated with agroecological zones, with those areas having higher agricultural potential being less affected by marginality. In Amartya Sen’s definition of human development, it is a process of enlarging people’s choices and freedoms. But in Husmann’s article, she defines marginality and spheres of life. In general, poverty, according to the author, falls in with whether one is in an area with marginality and which dimension the sphere of life is in. The analysis provided in the study is useful, giving insight on the issue of marginality in Ethiopia.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Nigeria, Ethiopia is the second most populated country in Sub-Saharan Africa. Of the seventy-three million people living in Ethiopia as of 2007, around eighty-seven percent live in rural areas and have their income based on agriculture related activities. Due to the low urbanization rate, the “economic weight” of cities remain low in comparison to other countries. So far, poverty reduction plans rely on agricultural and rural development investments. This is primarily due to the large population that spend their whole life on agriculture or rural activities. The Ministry of Planning and Economic Development of Ethiopia believes that the end result of pro-poor development will be rural based. The urban development, however, will play a central role during the next phase of the country’s development. The ministry outlines the challenges in the paper that Ethiopia faces when trying to raise urban centers. Approximately seventy percent of the urban population is considered “slum dwellers” based on factors such as quality of housing, overcrowded living spaces, access to shelter, and security of tenure. In larger cities, such as Addis Ababa, about sixty percent of the population are thought to be living below the poverty line. But overall, rural poverty rates dropped from 48 to 39 percent from 1995 to 2005 while urban poverty rates have increased from 33 to 35 percent over the same time period. The 2004 Ethiopian Household Survey shows that the urban and rural poverty rates are quite similar in regard to depth, severity, and poverty rates. Looking in the future, it is important for Ethiopia to set in place policies that incentivize city growth while also supporting the agricultural backbone of the economy. If it is managed properly, the country has many opportunities to develop market centers and cities that provide effective linkages to rural areas and vice versa. By developing more holistic strategies that take into account both the necessity of rural capacity building and income portfolio diversification, including urban development and demand-supply linkages, one should expect that many of the demands from Ethiopia’s cities should be recognized. This research seeks to provide a more “dynamic” assessment of Ethiopia’s urban growth during the last 25 years, but it also places the transformation within the context of ongoing debate of economic development and poverty reduction strategies.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper is focused on the importance of agriculture subsectors, and which ones aid in Ethiopia’s economic growth and poverty reduction. First, a spatially disaggregated, economy-wide model was developed. This enabled some analysis of growth and poverty reduction linkages at national and regional levels using household surveys and geographic information systems across the country. The study reveals that agriculture could be a crucial solution in the issue of poverty and increasing growth. Through out the years, Ethiopia has faced many challenges involving alleviating poverty and food security. Starting from the 1980’s Ethiopia has faced seven major droughts, and five of them resulted in a famine. In order to identify different kinds of investments that make the most impact on agricultural growth, which drive poverty reduction, a more profound understanding of the linkages between agriculture, economic growth, and poverty reduction is needed. The paper also emphasizes the need for “regionally differentiated strategies” in response to both the country’s massive size, and its heterogeneous natural resource and economic environments. Results from the study indicate that increasing national staple food availability by 50% by 2025 would greatly aid poverty reduction. Achieving a sustainable growth, however, requires investments in roads and other conditions. So, more than half the country’s poor live in the food deficit area, where the staple food availability per household is half of the national average. Stagnant agricultural growth leads to a higher poverty percentage. On this basis, the number of people living below the poverty line is estimated to increase by forty-one million by 2015, an increase from 2007 by ten million. Then, the majority of the country’s poor will continue to struggle to meet their basic needs, represented in the tables as average caloric intake, per capita per day. Combining the growth of all four major agricultural subsectors, however, might increase the economy by 5.1% and 5.3% per year in agriculture. This type of growth would bring the poverty rate down by as much at 18% to a final 27.5%  in 2015. This article relates to Sen through agriculture and poverty reduction. One of the unfreedoms in human development is access to food security. Once Ethiopia can resolve the issue of feeding the mass population, the poverty rate would naturally drop. The scientific question that the authors want to answer is which agricultural strategy would result in the most growth for the general economy, leading to more food, which would eventually result in an increase of poverty reduction.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary challenge for subsistence farmers (80% of the population) is the irregularity of rain expected rainy seasons- a factor that farmers have no control over. This study was focused on the qualitative and quantitative aspects for the utilization of GIS technology in Ethiopia as a backbone information infrastructure for rural development and drought management. The Geographic Information System offers an opportunity to analyze and compare different types of information, including digital or analog cartography. The utility of GIS can be observed in applications, which can range from protecting natural resources, identifying economic trends, to managing physical infrastructure. Therefore, the introduction of using GIS as a poverty reduction policy information infrastructure is concluded as the best option and will have the most effect on the transparency accountability. Relating to Sen’s definition of human development, the authors of this article believe that droughts should not be a limiting factor when it comes to food and income for Ethiopians. They want to use GIS to first improve the agricultural side of the gross domestic product of the country. By doing so, a large portion of the population will not have to worry about food as they try to develop their economy more. Most of the article discusses the issues of drought and famine conditions in the country and the contribution of the subsistence farmers to the country’s economy, as well as the efforts of Ethiopian governments to address these issues and the transformations of the rural economy. Then, the authors converse about the Poverty Reduction Policy program made by the government with relation to the drought prevention. And, the advantages of using GIS to improve the lives of the Ethiopian population is sketched out. Overall, GIS technology allows for high data integrity, actualization capability, and high-grade data management.
