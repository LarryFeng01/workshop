#### Response to Selim Jahan and Hans Rosling:
  
  Jahan mentions that the world used to focus on developing economically. First, we must make sure our country is stable, the average GDP per capita is stable, and the country is in an economically decent spot. Now that countries are stabilizing, there really isn’t a need to focus of all our energy on improving economically. So, Jahan states that the focus of the people should steer more towards themselves. What is the point of living in a good economic country if the standard of living is low? People should spend resources produced by themselves, on themselves instead of the country. Generally, Jahan believes that the people of the country are the center of action and should live as if they are. 
  
  In the data that Rosling provided, there is a strong correlation between the child survivability rate and the GDP per capita across the OECD, Latin America, East Europe, East Asia, Arab states, South Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa. Rosling states “we underestimate the tremendous social change that often precedes economic change.” For example, he talks about China; first, Mao Zedong brings health practices to China. Then, Deng Xiaoping brought “money”. Other examples include South Korea, Brazil, and Uganda. South Korea climbs very fast, increasing the child survival rate and GDP per capita. Brazil also moves linearly diagonal, but not as fast as S. Korea. Uganda struggles a little but eventually ends up to where S. Korea originally was in 1960. Finally, Rosling warns the dangers of averaging. After clicking on a country and splitting it into counties, the smaller regions can be spread over a great range, where the richest are in the upper 20% and the poorest are in the lowest 20%.
